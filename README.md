# NAI4Obsidian

Wouldn't you like little fren who writes with you? A brother in arms? A companion? A friend? An AI? Well, here you go. This is a plugin for Obsidian that allows you to write with the helpf of [NovelAI](https://novelai.net/). It's a very simple plugin, but it's a plugin nonetheless.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/SalokinGreen/nai-obsidian-plugin).
2. Extract the zip file into your `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/` folder.
3. Enable the plugin in the settings.

### Api Key

You can manually get your api key from [NovelAI](https://novelai.net/). You can also use the `get Key` command that uses your email and password to generate your api key.

#### Update

NAI recently introduced the update 'Persistent API Token Access' which gives you an api key that's a permanent solution, at least until you generate a new one.

### Generating

There are two commands, "generate" and "retry". Generate will generate a new prompt and retry will retry the last prompt. You have to asign a hotkey to these commands in the settings.

### Sub

You need a subscription to NovelAI to use this plugin. You can get one [here](https://novelai.net/).
